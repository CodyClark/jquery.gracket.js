A modern approach to handling tournament brackets in jQuery.

Built for http://itsgosu.com! 

------------------------------------------------------------

The plugin initializes itself. All you need to do is include the file and write the markup!

Step One: <div data-gracket='{object}' /> 
Step Two: Swap out the '{object}' for a real serialized JSON string or javascript object.
Step Three: Make sure the gracket plugin is loaded after the DOM is ready.

Feature's,

	1. Builds a tournament bracket that supports up to 1024 teams/players.
	2. Allows for infinite amount of grouping for teams/players.
	3. Each team/player has a "more info" dialog that can be triggered by a toggle or hover(default).
	4. The dialog will contain information found in the data-gracket object literal. 
	   It will identify specific key/values and display them accordingly (ie. Battle.net info, stats, etc...)

Extra's - You can pass more attributes to the data-gracket element.

	1. data-gracket-background - Uses a css3 background stretch technique to evenly display 
	   a single background image across the whole bracket.
	2. data-gracket-colors - Accepts a commas separated list of HEX or RGBA colors to fill
	   the bracket with. Not adding this will default to the style sheet colors.
