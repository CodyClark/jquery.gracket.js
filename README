V1.3
====

A modern approach to handling tournament brackets in jQuery.

Built for http://itsgosu.com! 

------------------------------------------------------------

The plugin initializes itself. All you need to do is include the file and write the markup!

Step One: <div data-gracket='{object}' /> 
Step Two: Swap out the '{object}' for a real serialized JSON string or javascript object.

Feature's,

	1. Builds a tournament bracket that supports up to 1024 teams/players.
	2. Each team/player has a "more info" dialog that can be triggered by a toggle or hover(default).

Extra's - You can pass more attributes to the data-gracket element.

	1. data-gracket-background - Uses a css3 background stretch technique to evenly display 
	   a single background image across the whole bracket.
